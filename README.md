# 🧠 Practice-Problems-CSE

A personal collection of programming problems I’ve solved and practiced from various sources to strengthen my understanding of **algorithms**, **data structures**, and **problem-solving strategies**.

This repository serves as my **learning log**, containing a mix of structured sets, university problems, and random challenges — all organized for long-term practice and quick reference.

```

Each folder contains `.c`, `.cpp`, or `.py` source files, usually with a brief problem description or source link in the comments.

---

## 💡 Purpose

- Build a **strong problem-solving foundation**
- Learn **core algorithmic patterns**
- Practice consistency through **daily problem solving**
- Track progress across different sources and difficulty levels

---

## ⚙️ Environment Setup

- **Languages:** C (mostly), with some C++ and Python
- **Compiler:** `gcc` / `g++`
- **Operating System:** Arch Linux (Hyprland) / Windows 11 (WSL)

To compile and run C programs:

```bash
gcc filename.c -o output && ./output
```

---

## 🚀 Future Plans

- Add **README.md** inside each category folder with problem lists and progress stats
- Add **difficulty tags** (Easy / Medium / Hard) for better navigation
- Include **solution explanations** for selected problems
- Track solved count dynamically using a script or JSON file
