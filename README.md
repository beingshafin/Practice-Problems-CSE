# 🧠 My Coding Vault

welcome to my personal **coding purgatory**, where i fight bugs, forget semicolons, and somehow learn algorithms along the way.
it’s a collection of problems i’ve solved (or rage-quit halfway) from different places — all part of my ongoing quest to become slightly less confused every day.

basically:

> sleep? no.
> compile errors? yes.
> arch user? obviously.
